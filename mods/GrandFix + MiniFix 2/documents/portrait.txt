User portraits are indexed from a message file called data\portrait\userport.mes that begins with message 1.  
You may have to create this file. Simply make a new text file and change the extension from txt to mes.

Each portrait is a 256 color BMP file that is 64 x 64 pixels. It's name
should have a three letter prefix which is 2 letters for race and one
letter for gender. This prefix defines which race-gender combination of a PC
or NPC can use this portrait.

The race prefixes are
HU - human
DW - dwarf
EL - elf
HE - half elf
GN - gnome
HA - halfling
HO - half orc
HG - half ogre

The gender prefixes are
M - male
F - female

Special prefixes
NPC - this portrait is useable only by NPC's, regardless of race or gender
ANY - anyone (PC or NPC of any race or gender) can use this portrait

Examples::
{1}{ELM1} means there is a portrait named data/portrait/ELM1.bmp which is
only available to elf males
{2}{ANYpretty} means there is a portrait named data/portrait/ANYpretty.bmp
which is useable by anyone
{3}{NPCbob} means there is a portrait named data/portrait/NPCbob.bmp that is
avialable to any NPC but not to PC's

For the larger versions of the portraits you can create a 128x128 BMP and append "_b" to its name. So if you have a regular portrait file called ELM1.bmp  you can create another called ELM1_b.bmp to be used for the bigger portrait. This does not have to be added to the userport.mes file, the game will automatically detect and use it. If the _b file does not exist, the game will simply scale up the smaller version.
